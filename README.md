# laboîte
Django web app of the laboîte project http://laboite.cc/help

## Getting Started

Make sure you are using a virtual environment of some sort (e.g. `virtualenv` or
`pyenv`).

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py loaddata sites
./manage.py createsuperuser
./manage.py runserver
```

You can then connect to the admin on http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin with the super
user you created above.
